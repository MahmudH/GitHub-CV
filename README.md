## Mahmud Hussain

I am seeking a Junior Developer role in London. I love building applications using various technologies I have learnt at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/). Read my code on [Github](https://github.com/MahmudH/).

### Code Examples

| Project Name  | Description |
| :-------------: |-------------|
| [Changr Mobile App](https://github.com/MahmudH/changr) | iOS app created in 14 days with a team of 4. The app intends to collaborate with homeless charities. The technologies involved are Swift, iOS 9, Estimote Beacons, Firebase, PayPal API, XCTest and Xcode. |
| [Daily Review App](https://github.com/MahmudH/daily_review_app)      | Built in 3 days in a team of 3. The app was built in order to help Makers Academy students project their feelings on how they feel about the challenge at hand and their overall emotions during the day in order for coaches to gain a better connection with students on a daily basis. The technologies involved are JavaScript, AngularJS framework, Firebase, HTML and CSS.       |
| [Takeaway Challenge](https://github.com/MahmudH/takeaway-challenge) | This was a weekend long challenge given by Makers Academy to create a restaurant program in Ruby using TDD and connecting our app to third part API's. Technologies involved in this app are Ruby, RSpec and Twilio API. |
